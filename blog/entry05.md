# Entry 5
##### 4/19/24

In entry 5 I have learned more about `Wow.js`. This is about my learning log as well as what I did. The first I learned was how to link to a CSS animation library `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">` As well as linking and activating `Wow.js`. Also, a thing I learned while reading was that on this website (https://wowjs.uk/docs). was that the way to choose the animation by using this:
````
                 	<div class="wow bounceInUp">
                  CONTENT TO REVEAL HERE!!!
                  </div>

````
This can help me understand how to link to a CSS animation library as well as the way to choose the animation by using this. Also for more info I used (https://www.javatpoint.com/wowjs#:~:text=js-,Wow.,these%20animations%20by%20triggering%20animate) To help me even more. I also learned that to add and initialize with `Java Script`. code is shown as here: `new WOW().int`. For more info use (https://github.com/matthieua/WOW?tab=readme-ov-file) this really helps me better understand how `Wow.js` works. But I know that most of the repo’s in the documentation are really old and might be out of date due to the lack of undated code. For one, if you wanted to reveal an element. You simply need to add a “wow” class to them, this way, the element will be invisible until you scroll to reveal the section:
````
<div class="wow">
CONTENT GOES HERE!!!
</div>


````
And I also learned that, in order to animate you would need the class wow rubberBand shown in this:
`
````
<div class="wow rubberBand">
    	ANIMATION GOES HERE!!!
</div>

This article titled “Making Awesome Animations using Animate.css and Wow.js” (https://medium.com/codebagng/making-awesome-animations-using-animate-css-and-wow-js-2e9ac4faad75) help me **a lot** to better understand how it all works.
