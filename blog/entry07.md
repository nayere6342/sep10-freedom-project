# Entry 7

To start off my entry. I had no issue with my website and `Wow.js`. I already know how HTML works as well as CSS. But, I had a some-what difficult time working with the `Wow.js` launcher. After some research, I got `Wow.js` to work. Here is the code in action:
```
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">
             <script src="js/wow.min.js"></script>
                <script>
              new WOW().init();
       </script>

``` 
This is for importing `Wow.js` onto the website. Also, along with learning `Wow.js`. I was also learning how to put `Wow.js` with CSS. I also used ​​the `Wow.js` documents. 
(https://wowjs.uk/docs.html) These documents helped me to understand how `Wow.js` works. Here is the CSS code for `Wow.js`:
```
       .wow_bounceInUp {
padding: 15px;
margin: 15px;
color: #000000;
}

```
As shown here. Firstly is the CSS class. This determines the part of the page that will get animated. Then is the padding and margin _that will be visual._ As well as the color. All of this help me in my website.
