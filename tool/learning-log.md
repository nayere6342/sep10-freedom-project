Tool: **Wow.js**

============

2/26/24:
One website I used was (https://wowjs.uk/docs) this website helped me to understand part of Wow.js that I didn't know. Such as linking to the CSS animation library ``<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">`` As well as linking and activate Wow.js. Another thing I learned while reading was that in this webpage. (https://www.javatpoint.com/wowjs#:~:text=js-,Wow.,these%20animations%20by%20triggering%20animate) This can help ``<section class="wow slideInLeft"></section>`` For the left and ``<section class="wow slideInRight"></section>``. One other thing I learn was that if you want to integrate Wow.js with a CSS file, add the following code snippet. ``<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">`` Also, for the process to proceed forward, you need to include adding and initializing it with Java-Script. The method is shown as follows: ``new WOW().int``. For more info use (https://github.com/matthieua/WOW?tab=readme-ov-file) this link can help with better understanding how Wow.js works. One major question I have is, can Wow.js work for other coding languages? A challenge I faced whole doing this project was that, some of the sources I found were out dated or broken links to the websites. Other then that, I believe that's it for Wow.js.
