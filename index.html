            <p class="sub-text"><b>What Is Chemistry?</b></p>
            <p class="sub-text">The study of chemistry spans the range from qualitative in focus to quantitative. The more qualitative chemist might work on synthesizing a new compound used in medicine, for example, while the more quantitative work can seem much like physics applied to the microscopic level of atoms and molecules.</p>
            <p class="sub-text">Chemicals are everywhere and are everything. Anything you can touch or smell or see contains one or more chemicals. Many occur naturally but some are man made. Chemists also discover naturally occurring chemicals and also make new ones never seen before. Chemists study the properties of the natural and man made chemicals. This information is used to understand how some chemicals may be modified to make them more useful and they develop the methods to make the modifications.</p>
            <p class="sub-text">Chemists seek to study the natural world but also seek to improve it by modification on a molecular level. Because everything is a chemical, chemistry is one of the foundations of modern industrial economies.</p>
            <p class="sub-text">Advancements in the field of chemistry have brought about major improvements in our world. Improvements range from new medicines that cure disease, to new materials that make us safer and stronger, to new sources of energy that enable new activities.</p>

        <center><h1 id="a">Existing Technology In Chemistry</h1></center>
        <li class="sub-text"> One tech is <i>Nanopesticides</i> “some predictions suggest we will be almost <b>10 billion humans</b> by 2050. Feeding that many people will require a <b>huge</b> increase in agricultural production while keeping crops sustainable: minimizing the environmental impact in terms of land use, reducing the amount of water needed, and mitigating the contamination by agrochemicals such as fertilizers or pesticides.” this is a form of pesticide that is used for farming. As well as the fact that "attracting quite a lot of attention beyond the pharma and health industries. Tailored nano-delivery systems could also become a great tool for farmers, as it would eventually allow them to tackle the main problems of conventional pesticides such as environmental contamination, bioaccumulation, and the huge increase in pest resistance.</li>

        <li class="sub-text">There are very few publications that carefully analyze the benefits—and risks—of so-called “nanoagrochemicals” against their conventional alternatives. In most cases, the increase in efficacy is quite limited. However, in some cases, researchers have observed improvements by an order of magnitude under laboratory conditions. We still need a proper assessment of the efficacy of nano pesticides under field conditions. That is why some companies still investigate their potential, proving that there is still hope for this technology. Nanotechnology may not be the only ingredient to a successful new, more sustainable agriculture, but it will certainly lead to more sophisticated agrochemicals with a lower impact on the environment and human health."

        <li class="sub-text">
            As well as "Along with flow chemistry comes reactive extrusion, a technique that allows chemical reactions to happen completely solvent-free. The elimination of potentially toxic solvents makes this process environmentally friendly. It creates however many engineering challenges as it would require a complete redesign of the industrial processes that are now in place. Although extrusion processes have been widely-used and investigated by polymer and material experts, it is only now that other chemists are starting to dig into their possibilities in the preparation of organic compounds. Classic extrusion methods involve grinding reagents in a ball mill, but more advanced extrusion technologies using screws could even allow these solvent-free reactions to operate in flow setups. Once again, the downside lays on effectively adapting the systems and scaling them up. In their labs, chemists have used ball mills to prepare several attractive products—amino acids, hydrazones, nitrones, and peptides—and have achieved some very classic organic reactions—Suzuki coupling, click chemistry—but the examples in reactive extrusion conditions beyond polymers remain quite elusive. chemists have recently reported the formation of metal-organic frameworks and discrete metal complexes by screw extrusion, opening the door to new possibilities towards a cleaner and more sustainable solvent-free chemistry."

        <center><h1 id="b">Possible Future Technology In Chemistry</h1></center>
        <li class="sub-text"><mark>One <u>possible</u> tech for Chemistry can be regrowing stem cells in the human body and allowing humans to activate so much more this can help us develop faster. In this article titled <i>'Organ Regeneration Through Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering'</i> it states that; "Loss of organ and tissue due to injuries or diseases led to the development of regenerative therapies to decrease reliance on organ transplantations. It deals with employing the self-renewal ability of stem cells to differentiate into numerous lineages to assist in providing effective treatment for a range of various injuries and diseases. Regenerative engineering of organs or tissues represents an ever-expanding field that is aimed at developing biological replacements for dysfunctional organs or injured tissues.</mark></li>

        <li class="sub-text"><mark>The critical issue, however, with the engineering of organs outside the human body is the insufficient availability of human cells, the absence of a suitable matrix with the same architecture and composition as the target tissue, and the maintenance of organ viability in the absence of the blood supply. The issue regarding the maintenance of the engineered organ viability can be solved using bioreactors consisting of mediums with defined chemical composition, i.e., nutrients, cofactors, and growth factors that can successively sustain the target cell’s viability. Engineered extracellular matrices and stem cells to regenerate organs outside the human body are also being used. Clinically, various adult stem cell therapies are readily under practice. This review will focus on the regeneration of organs through various types of stem cells and tissue engineering techniques."</mark></li>

        <li class="sub-text"><mark>As well as the fact that Generation of a Functional Prostate Gland From a Single Adult Tissue Stem Cell as shown here "By employing an assay for in vivo colony formation and transplantation approach of an in vivo renal capsule, it is possible to generate a functional prostate gland by isolating the single stem cell of an adult mouse prostate epithelium and utilizing its pluripotent ability. The existence of prostate stem cells was postulated because of their self-regenerating capacity following the deprivation of androgen and replacement. Due to cellular death after castration occurring in the luminal part of the cell, cell multiplication dominantly occurs in the basal compartment following the replacement of androgen. It is believed that the stem cells are present in the basal compartment of the cell and have the ability to repopulate the entire epithelial cells of the prostate [6]. For the generation of the prostate gland, first, for the prostate stem cells, the identification of a new marker CD117 is done. Identification is based on six features such as (i) the presence of a marker predominantly in the prostate’s proximal region; (ii) the marker should be expressed in the basal cell population; (iii) after castration, it should be upregulated and returned to its normal levels after androgen replacement; (iv) only CD117+ cells should have the ability to form in vivo colony structures with lumen; (v) second and third-generation CD117+ cells should have regeneration capability; and, lastly, (vi) the markers should have the ability to generate prostate epithelial glandular structures in vivo"</mark></li>
