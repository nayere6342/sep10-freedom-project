# Entry 3
##### 12/19/23

This unit has a lot but to start off my third entry. In this entry I will be focusing on command lines, and git. First is command lines, this is very simple, the first command is `mkdir` this just makes a directory and an example of this command is `mkdir sample.` It is that easy. Another commands like `pwd` this command can Prints working directory (Directory=folder) (Tells you where you are). Other commands like `ls` that just List out all files in directory and `cd` which can move into anther directory (cd... = Takes you to parent)(od brooklyn goes into od directory brooklyn) (only works from parent directory) (cd../sunset park = goes into parent and then sibling) (cd ~= takes you home). It is also important to know that git is similar to the command lines but git helps a ton when it comes to the commands like `rm` this can remove directory and files but the down side of this is that it canâ€™t do anything about the files in the directory. Fear not, because `rm -f*` can delete everything in the directory and the directory itself and `mv` (to rename) just Renames file mv (existing name) (new name) and `mv` (to move) this move it and not rename you have to have a file that exists or else it will rename are **two different commands.** One more thing, `code file` goes to the flie of your project. If you ever want to preview your code, you can use `http-server` this will preview the code. To conclude my entry, this unit was the best by along shot.
