## Part A: existing technology
* Tech: Nanopesticides
  * One tech is Nanopesticides “some predictions suggest we will be almost 10 billion humans by 2050. Feeding that many people will require a huge increase in agricultural production while keeping crops sustainable: minimizing the environmental impact in terms of land use, reducing the amount of water needed, and mitigating the contamination by agrochemicals such as fertilizers or pesticides.” this is a form of pesticide that is used for farming and this was from (https://cgu-odisha.ac.in/blog/top-10-emerging-technologies-in-chemistry/)

## Part B: possible future technology
* Idea: regrowing stem cells
  * One possible tech for Chemistry can be regrowing stem cells in the human body and allowing humans to activate so much more this can help us develop faster.
