# Entry 7

To start off my entry. I had no issue with my website and `Wow.js`. I already know how HTML works as well as CSS. But, I had a some-what difficult time working with the `Wow.js` launcher. After some research, I got `Wow.js` to work. Here is the code in action:
```
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">
             <script src="js/wow.min.js"></script>
                <script>
              new WOW().init();
       </script>

``` 
This is for importing `Wow.js` onto the website. Also, along with learning `Wow.js`. I was also learning how to put `Wow.js` with CSS. I also used ​​the `Wow.js` documents. 
(https://wowjs.uk/docs.html) These documents helped me to understand how `Wow.js` works. Here is the CSS code for `Wow.js`:
```
       .wow_bounceInUp {
padding: 15px;
margin: 15px;
color: #000000;
}

```
As shown here. Firstly is the CSS class. This determines the part of the page that will get animated. Then is the padding and margin _that will be visual._ As well as the color. All of this helps me on my website. I also used CSS to touch up the images and make them stand out. Here is the CSS code for that;
```
#img {
   width: 40%;
   height: 40%;
   margin: 5%;
   border: 10px solid #f75f57;
   border-radius: 25px;
}

```
This helped me to touch up the images and make them stand out in my website. This also helps to resize the image to a normal size. This is a key part. Due to the fact that if someone were to import the raw image file. The image will be ridiculously big and take up the entire screen. That’s why I used CSS to help me work with my website. One last thing, I also used CSS for my navbar. Here is the code to prove it:
```
  .topnav {
    background-color: #f5e9e9;
    color: #be53db;
    padding: 10px;
}


```
As well as the `div` I stored it in:
```
  div {
    list-style-type: none;
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 10px;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 30px;
    background-color: #f5e9e9;
}


```
And that’s how I learn `Wow.js` as well as CSS in my website that I have created called “The Chemistry Web”. Some takeaways I have from my experience in the website I made are,
* One major problem I had was my `IDE` crashing.
* _For some reason, my `IDE` would just crash out of the blue._
*  _I would lose *ALL* of my progress because of this._
* One other takeaway I faced was my github preview breaking up at times.
* Also, next time I try this I would have helped myself more.
* _I write all of the code by memory._
* _The navbar, all the content was made by me._
* One last takeaway I have from my experience.
* _I procrastinate a lot while making my website._
