For starters, Wow.js is an animation tool that is a part of java that can be used for websites. This tool can really spice up your websites by making object movements. Such as moving in from the left, moving in from the right. As well as moving out from the left, moving out from the right. You can also change the X, Y, and Z axis. Another thing you can change is object rotation and object fade. Object rotation is a way to change the rotation of that object. This can be used for a scripted event where the object should rotate the script for that would be `animate__rotateIn` and the opposite would be `animate__rotateOut`. If you wanted to use a fade-in or fade-out that would be `animate__fadeIn` `animate__fadeOut`. Wow.js allows you to manipulate text, like using the text flip command like so; ‘animate__flip’ but if you wanted to be even more precise you could use `animate__flipInX` and `animate__flipInY` and opposite would be `animate__flipOutX` and `animate__flipOutY`.
