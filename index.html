        <center><h1 id="a">Existing Technology In Chemistry</h1></center>
        <p class="sub-text"> One tech is <i>Nanopesticides</i> “some predictions suggest we will be almost <b>10 billion humans</b> by 2050. Feeding that many people will require a <b>huge</b> increase in agricultural production while keeping crops sustainable: minimizing the environmental impact in terms of land use, reducing the amount of water needed, and mitigating the contamination by agrochemicals such as fertilizers or pesticides.” this is a form of pesticide that is used for farming. As well as the fact that "attracting quite a lot of attention beyond the pharma and health industries. Tailored nano-delivery systems could also become a great tool for farmers, as it would eventually allow them to tackle the main problems of conventional pesticides such as environmental contamination, bioaccumulation, and the huge increase in pest resistance. There are very few publications that carefully analyze the benefits—and risks—of so-called “nanoagrochemicals” against their conventional alternatives. In most cases, the increase in efficacy is quite limited. However, in some cases, researchers have observed improvements by an order of magnitude under laboratory conditions. We still need a proper assessment of the efficacy of nano pesticides under field conditions. That is why some companies still investigate their potential, proving that there is still hope for this technology. Nanotechnology may not be the only ingredient to a successful new, more sustainable agriculture, but it will certainly lead to more sophisticated agrochemicals with a lower impact on the environment and human health."

        <center><h1 id="b">Possible Future Technology In Chemistry</h1></center>
        <p class="sub-text">One <u>possible</u> tech for Chemistry can be regrowing stem cells in the human body and allowing humans to activate so much more this can help us develop faster. In this article titled <i>'Organ Regeneration Through Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering'</i> it states that; "Loss of organ and tissue due to injuries or diseases led to the development of regenerative therapies to decrease reliance on organ transplantations. It deals with employing the self-renewal ability of stem cells to differentiate into numerous lineages to assist in providing effective treatment for a range of various injuries and diseases. Regenerative engineering of organs or tissues represents an ever-expanding field that is aimed at developing biological replacements for dysfunctional organs or injured tissues. The critical issue, however, with the engineering of organs outside the human body is the insufficient availability of human cells, the absence of a suitable matrix with the same architecture and composition as the target tissue, and the maintenance of organ viability in the absence of the blood supply. The issue regarding the maintenance of the engineered organ viability can be solved using bioreactors consisting of mediums with defined chemical composition, i.e., nutrients, cofactors, and growth factors that can successively sustain the target cell’s viability. Engineered extracellular matrices and stem cells to regenerate organs outside the human body are also being used. Clinically, various adult stem cell therapies are readily under practice. This review will focus on the regeneration of organs through various types of stem cells and tissue engineering techniques."</p>
