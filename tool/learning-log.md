# *Tool Learning Log:*

Tool: **Wow.js**

============

LL1

**2/26/24:**

* One website I used was (https://wowjs.uk/docs) this website helped me to understand part of Wow.js that I didn't know. Such as linking to the CSS animation library ``<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">`` As well as linking and activate Wow.js. Another thing I learned while reading was that in this webpage. (https://www.javatpoint.com/wowjs#:~:text=js-,Wow.,these%20animations%20by%20triggering%20animate) This can help ``<section class="wow slideInLeft"></section>`` For the left and ``<section class="wow slideInRight"></section>``. One other thing I learn was that if you want to integrate Wow.js with a CSS file, add the following code snippet. ``<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">``

* Also, for the process to proceed forward, you need to include adding and initializing it with Java-Script. The method is shown as follows: ``new WOW().int``. For more info use (https://github.com/matthieua/WOW?tab=readme-ov-file) this link can help with better understanding how Wow.js works.

LL3 & LL4

**3/14/24:**

* One major question I have is, can Wow.js work for other coding languages? A challenge I faced whole doing this project was that, some of the sources I found were out dated or broken links to the websites. Other then that, I believe that's it for Wow.js. As well as how can Wow.js be implemented other things? _(not just websites)_

LL5

**3/27/24:**

* One big thing I have learned in learning log 5 was that, if you wanted to reveal an element. You simply need to add a “wow” class to them, this way, the element will be invisible until you scroll to reveal the section.
````
<div class="wow">
    This is some content to be revealed
</div>
````
* The article I found this infomation is titled "Making Awesome Animations using Animate.css and Wow.js" at (https://medium.com/codebagng/making-awesome-animations-using-animate-css-and-wow-js-2e9ac4faad75). And this article was really helpful for me because I understood the way everything worked and how to implement this into other places in my website.
