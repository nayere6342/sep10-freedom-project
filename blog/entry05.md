##### 4/19/24

In entry 5 I have learned more about `Wow.js`. This is about my learning log as well as what I did. The first I learned was how to link to a CSS animation library `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">` As well as linking and activating `Wow.js`. Also, a thing I learned while reading was that on this website (https://wowjs.uk/docs). was that the way to choose the animation by using this:
````
  <div class="wow bounceInUp">
Content to Reveal Here
</div>

````
