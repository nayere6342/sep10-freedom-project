            <p class="sub-text">The study of <b>chemistry spans</b> the range from qualitative in focus to quantitative. The more qualitative chemist might work on synthesizing a new compound used in medicine, for example, while the more quantitative work can seem much like <u>physics applied to the microscopic level of atoms and molecules.</u></p>
            <p class="sub-text"><b>Chemicals are everywhere and are everything.</b> Anything you can <i>touch or smell or see</i> contains <u>one or more chemicals.</u> Many occur naturally but some are man made. <u>Chemists also discover naturally occurring chemicals and also make new ones never seen before.</u> Chemists study the properties of the natural and man made chemicals. This information is used to understand how some chemicals may be modified to make them more useful and they develop the methods to make the modifications.</p>
            <p class="sub-text"><u>Chemists seek to study the natural world but also seek to improve it by modification on a molecular level.</u> Because everything is a chemical, chemistry is one of the foundations of modern industrial economies.</p>

        <li class="key"> One tech is <i>Nanopesticides</i> “some predictions suggest we will be almost <b>10 billion humans <u>by 2050.</u></b> Feeding that many people will require <b>a huge increase in agricultural production while keeping crops sustainable: minimizing the environmental impact in terms of land use,</b> reducing the amount of water needed, and mitigating the contamination by agrochemicals such as fertilizers or pesticides.” this is a form of pesticide that is used for farming. <u>As well as the fact that "attracting quite a lot of attention beyond the pharma and health industries. Tailored nano-delivery systems could also become a great tool for farmers, as it would eventually allow them to tackle the main problems of conventional pesticides such as environmental contamination, bioaccumulation, and the huge increase in pest resistance.</u></li>

        <li class="sub-text"><u>There are very few publications that carefully analyze the benefits—and risks—of so-called <i>“nanoagrochemicals”</i> against their conventional alternatives.</u> In most cases, the increase in efficacy is quite limited. <u><i>However,</i> in some cases, researchers have observed improvements by an order of magnitude under laboratory conditions. We <b>*still*</b> need a proper assessment of the efficacy of nano pesticides under field conditions.</u> That is why some companies still investigate their potential, proving that there is still hope for this technology. Nanotechnology may not be the only ingredient to a successful new, more sustainable agriculture, but it will certainly lead to more sophisticated agrochemicals with a lower impact on the environment and human health."
        </li>

        <li class="sub-text">
            <i> - As well as</i> "Along with flow chemistry comes reactive extrusion, a technique that allows chemical reactions to happen completely solvent-free. <b>The elimination of potentially toxic solvents makes this process environmentally friendly. It creates however many engineering challenges as it would require a complete redesign of the industrial processes that are now in place. Although extrusion processes have been widely-used and investigated by polymer and material experts, it is only now that other chemists are starting to dig into their possibilities in the preparation of organic compounds.</b> Classic extrusion methods involve grinding reagents in a ball mill, but more advanced extrusion technologies using screws could even allow these solvent-free reactions to operate in flow setups. Once again, the downside lays on effectively adapting the systems and scaling them up. <u>In their labs, chemists have used ball mills to prepare several attractive products—amino acids, hydrazones, nitrones, and peptides—and have achieved some very classic organic reactions—Suzuki coupling, click chemistry—but the examples in reactive extrusion conditions beyond polymers remain quite elusive.</u> chemists have recently reported the formation of metal-organic frameworks and discrete metal complexes by screw extrusion, opening the door to new possibilities towards a cleaner and more sustainable solvent-free chemistry."

        <li class="sub-text"><u>One possible tech for Chemistry can be regrowing stem cells in the human body and allowing humans to activate so much more this can help us develop faster.</u> In this article titled <i>'Organ Regeneration Through Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering'</i> it states that; "Loss of organ and tissue due to injuries or diseases led to the development of regenerative therapies to decrease reliance on organ transplantations. It deals with employing the self-renewal ability of stem cells to differentiate into numerous lineages to assist in providing <u><b>effective treatment for a range of various injuries and diseases. Regenerative engineering of organs or tissues represents an ever-expanding field that is aimed at developing biological replacements for dysfunctional organs or injured tissues.</b></u></li>

        <li class="sub-text"><b>The critical issue,</b> however, with the engineering of organs outside the human body is the insufficient availability of human cells, the absence of a <u>suitable matrix with the same architecture and composition as the target tissue, and the maintenance of organ viability in the absence of the blood supply.</u> The issue regarding the maintenance of the engineered organ viability can be solved using bioreactors consisting of mediums with defined chemical composition, <i>i.e,</i> <u>nutrients, cofactors, and growth factors that can successively sustain the target cell’s viability.</u> Engineered extracellular matrices and stem cells to regenerate organs outside the human body are also being used. Clinically, <u>various adult stem cell</u> therapies are readily under practice. This review will focus on the <b>regeneration of organs through various types of stem cells and tissue engineering techniques.</b>"</li>

        <li class="sub-text"><u>As well as the fact that;</u> <i>Generation of a Functional Prostate Gland From a Single Adult Tissue Stem Cell</i> as shown here "By employing an assay for in vivo colony formation and transplantation approach of an in vivo renal capsule, it is possible to generate a functional prostate gland by isolating the single stem cell of an adult mouse prostate epithelium and utilizing its pluripotent ability. The existence of prostate stem cells was postulated because of their self-regenerating capacity following the deprivation of androgen and replacement. <u>Due to cellular death after castration occurring in the luminal part of the cell, cell multiplication dominantly occurs in the basal compartment following the replacement of androgen.</u> It is believed that the stem cells are present in the basal compartment of the cell and have the ability to repopulate the entire epithelial cells of the prostate. For the generation of the prostate gland, first, for the prostate stem cells, the identification of a new marker <b><u>CD117</u></b> is done. Identification is based on six features such as <b>(i)</b> the presence of a marker predominantly in the prostate’s proximal region; <b>(ii)</b> the marker should be expressed in the basal cell population; <b>(iii)</b> after castration, it should be upregulated and returned to its normal levels after androgen replacement; <b>(iv)</b> only <b><u>CD117+</u></b> cells should have the ability to form in vivo colony structures with lumen; <b>(v)</b> second and third-generation <b><u>CD117+</u></b> cells should have regeneration capability; and, lastly, <b>(vi)</b> the markers should have the ability to generate prostate epithelial glandular structures in vivo"</li>

            <center><h1 id="h">The History Of Chemistry</h1></center>
            <p class="sub-text">Where did chemistry come from? Early "chemists" focused on practical problems—how to make dyes and perfumes, soap manufacture, uses of metals, and glass production, among others. The goal was not to understand the physical world—that came later. People just wanted to make things that would improve their lives in some way. The history of chemistry is an interesting and challenging one. Very early chemists were often motivated mainly by the achievement of a specific goal or product. Making perfume and soaps did not require much theory, just a good recipe and careful attention to detail. There was no standard way of naming materials (and no periodic table that everyone could agree on). However, the science developed over the centuries.</p>
            <p class="key">Major progress was made in putting chemistry on a solid foundation when Robert Boyle (1637-1691) began his research in chemistry. He developed the basic ideas for the behavior of gases; gases could thereafter be described mathematically. Boyle also helped pioneer the idea that small particles could combine to form molecules. Many years later, John Dalton used these ideas to develop the atomic theory.</p>
            <p class="sub-text">The field of chemistry began to develop rapidly in the 1700s. Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) isolated and characterized several gases: oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide. It was later discovered that nitrous oxide ("laughing gas") worked as an anesthetic. This gas was used for that purpose for the first time in 1844 during a tooth extraction. Other gases discovered during that time were chlorine, by C.W. Scheele (1742-1786) and nitrogen, by Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794). Lavoisier has been considered by many scholars to be the "father of chemistry".</p>
            <p class="key">Chemists continued to discover new compounds in the 1800s. The science also began to develop a more theoretical foundation. John Dalton (1766-1844) put forth his atomic theory in 1807. This idea allowed scientists to think about chemistry in a much more systematic way. Amadeo Avogadro (1776-1856) laid the groundwork for a more quantitative approach to chemistry by calculating the number of particles in a given amount of a gas. A lot of effort was put forth in studying chemical reactions. These efforts led to new materials being produced. Following the invention of the battery by Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), the field of electrochemistry (both theory and application) developed through major contributions by Humphry Davy (1778-1829) and Michael Faraday (1791-1867). Other areas of the discipline also progressed rapidly.</p>
            <p class="sub-text">It would take a large book to cover developments in chemistry during the twentieth century and up to today. One major area of expansion was in the area of the chemistry of living processes. Research in photosynthesis in plants, the discovery and characterization of enzymes as biochemical catalysts, elucidation of the structures of biomolecules such as insulin and DNA —these efforts gave rise to an explosion of information in the field of biochemistry. The practical aspects of chemistry were not ignored. The work of Volta, Davy, and Faraday eventually led to the development of batteries that provided a source of electricity to power a number of devices.</p>
            <p class="sub-text">Charles Goodyear (1800-1860) discovered the process of vulcanization, allowing a stable rubber product to be produced for the tires of all the vehicles that we have today. Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) pioneered the use of heat sterilization to eliminate unwanted microorganisms in wine and milk. Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) invented dynamite. After his death, the fortune he made from this product was used to fund the Nobel Prizes in science and the humanities. J.W. Hyatt (1837-1920) developed the first plastic. Leo Baekeland (1863-1944) developed the first synthetic resin, which is widely used for inexpensive and sturdy dinnerware.</p>
