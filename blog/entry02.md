To start off my Blog, this unit was about three major topics: Basic, Positioning, and Animation. My team worked on positioning. Positioning can help your website’s text look better. As well as making your div’s stand out. It is important to know that positioning is hard at first but if you want to learn positioning you must learn the basics. Basic can help you learn how to do the base of your coding. It will take you five weeks to learn the basics. It is easy to learn the basics so that’s  what everyone who codes starts off with. Now, Animation is in fact more difficult than positioning or basics but when you get the hang of it, it will be very easy. Animation will make anything move whether it is text or an image. Animation will bring it to life. With the power of all three coding startups your website will shine.
