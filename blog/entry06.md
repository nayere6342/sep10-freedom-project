# Entry 6
5/1/24

For entry six I have decided to talk more about my MVP. First of all, the navbar was the first thing I had made in my webpage. This was the most important thing for my webpage about chemistry. I gave each part an `id`. This is the mean part of my navbar. As shown here:
````
        <div class="topnav">
            <text><center><h1 id="txt">Welcome To The Chemistry Web</h1></center>/</text>
            <a class="topnav" href="#a">Nanopesticides</a> <text>/</text>
            <a class="topnav" href="#b">Stem Cells</a> <text>/</text>
            <a class="topnav" href="#c">Credits</a> <text>/</text>
          </div>

```` 
it helps the user go to different parts of the pages without scrolling to that part _this will save the user time in the long-run._ Is it user friendly? Yes, by adding this, `id system`. It will help the user get to things faster. Also in my webpage I have added images that help the user better understand what is going on as well as making it user friendly. As shown here: `<center><img id="img" src="https://www.mdpi.com/jcm/jcm-09-03307/article_deploy/html/images/jcm-09-03307-g001.png"` This shows that the image is centered and has the `id` titled `“img”`. I also added a “Learn More” link to see more information about that part of that page. Like this: `<center><b><a class= "info" href="https://cgu-odisha.ac.in/blog/top-10-emerging-technologies-in-chemistry/">Learn More</a></b></center>` As shown here, it has a class of `info` and it has the link to the website with all of the information.
