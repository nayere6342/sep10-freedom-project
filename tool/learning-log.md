One website I used was https://wowjs.uk/docs this website helped me to understand part of Wow.js that I didn't know. Such as linking to the CSS animation library ``<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">`` As well as linking and activate wow.js. Another thing I learned while reading was that in this webpage. https://www.javatpoint.com/wowjs#:~:text=js-,Wow.,these%20animations%20by%20triggering%20animate This can help ``<section class="wow slideInLeft"></section>`` For the left and ``<section class="wow slideInRight"></section>``. One other thing I learn was that if you want to integrate wow.js with a CSS file, add the following code snippet. ``<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">``
